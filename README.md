# Batesian Mimicry Simulation

This project simulates Batesian mimicry, where harmless species evolve to imitate the warning signals of harmful species. The simulation allows users to observe how the populations of monarchs and viceroys change over time as birds learn to avoid the harmful monarchs.

## Project Structure

- **index.html**: Contains the Batesian Mimicry Simulation (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript). This is also the GitHub Pages entry point.
- **.github/workflows/pages.yml**: GitHub Actions workflow configuration that automates the deployment of the project to GitHub Pages.
- **README.md**: Documentation for the project, including setup instructions, usage, and other relevant information.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mimicry-pages.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd mimicry-pages
   ```

3. Open `index.html` in a web browser to view the simulation.

## Usage

- Click the **Setup** button to initialize the simulation.
- Adjust the sliders to modify the mutation rate, memory duration, and memory size.
- Click **Go** to start the simulation and observe how the populations evolve over time.
- Click **Stop** to pause the simulation.
